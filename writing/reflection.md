TODO: Please make sure that you also completely delete the TODO markers and
their labels from every line of the `writing/reflection.md` file. This means
that you should not simply delete the `TODO` marker but instead delete the
entire prompt so that your reflection is a document that contains polished
technical writing that is suitable for publication on your professional web
site.

TODO: Make sure that all aspects of the writing/reflection.md` correctly use all
of the features of the Markdown standard. This means that, when you preview your
Markdown inside of GitHub is should always be formatted in a suitable fashion.

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response to this question.

#### What are the inputs and outputs of the `determine_even_odd` function?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response to this question.

#### Does the computation `10.0 * 0.1` produce the value of `1.0`? Why?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response to this question.

#### Does the `for` loop in the `floating-point-confusion` produce the value of `1.0`? Why or why not?

NOTE: For your reference, here is the source code that contains the `for` loop:

```python
for _ in range(10):
    number = number + 0.1
```
