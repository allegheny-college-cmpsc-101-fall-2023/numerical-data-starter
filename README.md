## Introduction

- Due date: Check the [Proactive Programmers Discord
server](https://discord.gg/kjah8MFYbR).
- This assignment will be submitted on GitHub following
the expectations in the syllabus on
[Assignment Submission](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-fall-2023/course-materials#assignment-submission).
- To begin, read this `README` and the Proactive Programmers' project
description for
[Numerical Data](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/source-code-surveys/numerical-data/)
- This assignment is a Source Code Survey and will be evaluated as
described in the
[Assessment Strategies](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/proactive-learning/assessment-strategy/#source-code-surveys)

## Seeking Assistance

Please review the course expectations on the syllabus about
[Seeking Assistance](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-fall-2023/course-materials#seeking-assistance).
Students are reminded
to uphold the Honor Code. Cloning the assignment repository is a
commitment to the latter.

For this assignment, you may use class materials, textbooks, notes, and the
internet. However,
when asked to write "in your own words", you must use _your own_ words.

Post questions to the [Proactive Programmers Discord server](https://discord.gg/kjah8MFYbR).

## Project Overview

After cloning this repository to your computer, please take the following
steps:

- Make sure that you have already installed and know how to use all of the
  programming tools that are mentioned in the description of the [Proactive
  Skills](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/proactive-skills/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills/).
- Use the `cd` command to change into the directory for this repository.
- At this point, run `gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml` and check whether
the output matches the gatorgrade output reported in GitHub actions.
  - if they do not match:
    - create a virtual environment in your local directory!
    - run `python -m venv ./.venv`
    - run `source .venv/bin/activate`
    - rerun and recheck the local gatorgrade output report for a match with GitHub actions!
- Change into the program source code directory by typing `cd source`.
- Run the provided Python scripts by typing the following:
  - `python determine-even-odd.py`: demonstrate computation with integer values and modular arithmetic
  - `python floating-point-confusion.py`: demonstrate computation with floating-point values
  - `python type-annotation.py`: practice thinking about and using type annotations
- Follow the
  [instructions](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/source-code-surveys/numerical-data/) on the Proactive Programmers web site for this project
  to take all of the needed steps and to complete all of the required
  deliverables.
- Confirm that the programs are producing the expected output.
- Make sure that you can explain why the programs produce the output that they do.
- Don't forget to provide all of the required responses to the technical writing
  prompts in the `writing/reflection.md` file.
- Please make sure that you completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
  labels from all of the provided source code. This means that instead of only
  deleting the `TODO` marker from the code you should instead delete the `TODO`
  marker and the entire prompt and then add your own comments to demonstrate
  that you understand all of the source code in this project.
- Please make sure that you also completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
  labels from every line of the `writing/reflection.md` file. This means that
  you should not simply delete the `TODO` marker but instead delete the entire
  prompt so that your reflection is a document that contains polished technical
  writing that is suitable for publication on your professional web site.
